Sustainable Cities Needed!
Problem E: Sustainable Cities Needed!
Background:
Many communities are implementing smart growth initiatives in an effort to consider
long range, sustainable planning goals. “Smart growth is about helping every town and
city become a more economically prosperous, socially equitable, and environmentally
sustainable place to live.”[2] Smart growth focuses on building cities that embrace the
E’s of sustainability—Economically prosperous, socially Equitable, and Environmentally
Sustainable. This task is more important than ever because the world is rapidly
urbanizing. It is projected that by 2050, 66 percent of the world’s population will be
urban—this will result in a projected 2.5 billion people being added to the urban
population.[3] Consequently, urban planning has become increasingly important and
necessary to ensure that people have access to equitable and sustainable homes,
resources and jobs.
Smart growth is an urban planning theory that originated in 1990’s as a means to curb
continued urban sprawl and reduce the loss of farmland surrounding urban centers. The
ten principles for smart growth are[4]
1 Mix land uses
2 Take advantage of compact building design
3 Create a range of housing opportunities and choices
4 Create walkable neighborhoods
5 Foster distinctive, attractive communities with a strong sense of place
6 Preserve open space, farmland, natural beauty, and critical environmental areas
7 Strengthen and direct development towards existing communities
8 Provide a variety of transportation choices
9 Make development decisions predictable, fair, and cost effective
10 Encourage community and stakeholder collaboration in development decisions
These broad principles must be tailored to a community’s unique needs to be effective.
Thus, any measure of success must incorporate the demographics, growth needs, and
geographical conditions of a city as well as the goal to adhere to the three E’s. 
Tasks:
The International City Management Group (ICM) needs your help implementing smart
growth theories into city design around the world. Select two mid-sized cities (any city
with a population of between 100,000 and 500,000 persons), on two different
continents.
1. Define a metric to measure the success of smart growth of a city. It should
consider the three E’s of sustainability and/or the 10 principles of smart growth.
2. Research the current growth plan of the selected cities. Measure and discuss
how the current growth plan of each city meets the smart growth principles. How
successful are the current plans according to your metric?
3. Using smart growth principles develop a growth plan for both cities over the next
few decades. Support why you chose the components and initiatives of your
plans based on the geography, expected growth rates, and economic
opportunities of your cities. Use your metric to evaluate the success of your
smart growth plans.
4. Also using your metric, rank the individual initiatives within your redesigned smart
growth plan as the most potential to the least potential. Compare and contrast
the initiatives and their ranking between the two cities.
5. Suppose the population of each city will increase by an additional 50% by 2050,
explain in what way(s) your plan supports this level of growth?
Your ICM submission should consist of a 1 page Summary Sheet and your solution cannot
exceed 20 pages for a maximum of 21 pages. Note: The appendix and references do not count
toward the 20 page limit.
